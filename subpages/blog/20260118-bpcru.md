# BP Cru, the intersection of extremes | 18.10.2026


Tonight, at 5:25:19 UTC of the 19th of January, the [Hubble Space Telescope (HST)](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) will be staring at the Southern Cross (Crux, or Cruzeiro do Sul em português). For the first time, a very special star will be observed! Its most famous name is [*BP Cru*](https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=BP+Cru&submit=SIMBAD+search). In our line of sight, BP Cru lies close to [α Cru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrux), the brightest star in the constellation.

>The name "BP Cru" corresponds to the star's designation at the [General Catalog of Variable Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Catalogue_of_Variable_Stars).


BP Cru is actually two stars engaged in a very macabre dance. One of them is a cool blue hypergiant, an aged behemoth seventy times larger and forty times more massive than our Sun. The other is a tiny, tiny neutron star -- the remnant of an even heavier behemoth that died long ago.  
This dead star, whose internal structure defies and haunts our astrophysical understanding, is no larger than 20 km, yet it has a mass two or three times that of the Sun -- pause for a moment and contemplate that!  
We have here a giant monster dancing a fifty-day-long dance with a zombie. And it is a dance that is anything but boring.

>We say a star is alive if it still fuses atoms into other atoms in its core to produce energy, preventing it from collapsing under its own weight. "Dead stars" like neutron stars are not made of normal atoms and sustain themselves through physical processes wilder than science fiction.

*Artistic impression and collage of BP Cru. Both the location as well as the binary system configuration are shown. The neutron star, represented as the white shiny speckle, orbits around the blue hypergiant. As it moves inside the dense wind of the blue star, it emits copious amounts of X-rays. For scale the sun is represented with an orange dot. The image of Crux is the photometry collected by [DSS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitized_Sky_Survey) and modified in Inkscape. This work was crafter in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

Massive stars live fast and die quickly -- at least in astronomical terms, lasting only a few million years. However, their brightness, winds, and violent deaths as supernovae change the course of entire galaxies and forge most of the atoms that make up you and me. Therefore, understanding how these stars live and die is fundamental to understanding where we came from and why the night sky looks the way it does. Most high-mass stars, alive or dead, dance or have danced with another star. Often, such dances between a dead and an alive massive star produce X-rays, producing what we call High-Mass X-ray Binaries.

>The term "High Mass X-ray Binary" refers to any system made of a dead massive star, like a black hole or a neutron star, and a massive star orbiting each other and emitting X-rays because of their interaction  -- yes, the same radiation used to image our bones!


BP Cru is the only known system where this exact type of behemoth -- a cool blue hypergiant -- is leading its dead companion in such a dance. The hypergiant is so large and bright that it launches its surface layers into space as a stellar wind. As the neutron star orbits through this wind, it violently pulls the surrounding gas toward itself. The friction of the infalling gas produces copious amounts of X-rays.

With its uniqueness, BP Cru may be the only observable example of a very brief snapshot in the life of certain high-mass stellar systems. How did such a system come to be? Why don’t we see more systems like it? How long can this system survive? What impacts will it have when it dies? We don’t know yet, but learning more about the past, present, and future of these dancing monsters will reveal exciting things about massive stars, and eventually about the Universe as a whole!

*Abraços, MBP*

PS: Some personal coincidences about this are remarkable! BP is the acronym of my surname, and Cruzeiro do Sul, was the first constellation I identified in the night sky when I was a child! Also, the observations were originally scheduled for 2027, but last week the first of them were rescheduled for tonight! It is a true existential pleasure to be traveling to the place where I grew up (Rio de Janeiro), gazing at the Southern Cross while the HST collects data for [my very first successful first-author observational proposal](https://www.stsci.edu/hst-program-info/program/?program=18129)! Fingers crossed for clear skies in Rio and a smooth observation by HST!
