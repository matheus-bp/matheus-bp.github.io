For the first time, a very special star will be observed in the ultraviolet with high definition&#33; Its most famous name is <a href="https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident&#61;BP&#43;Cru&amp;submit&#61;SIMBAD&#43;search"><em>BP Cru</em></a>. BP Cru is at twelve thousand light-years away from us<a href="#references">&#91;1&#93;</a>, which means that the light we see now was emitted from its surface when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age">Ice Age</a> &#40;the geological period, not the movies&#33;&#41; was ending. In our line of sight, BP Cru lies close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrux">α Cru</a>, the brightest star in the constellation – see figure below. </p> <blockquote> <p>The name &quot;BP Cru&quot; corresponds to the star&#39;s designation at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Catalogue_of_Variable_Stars">General Catalog of Variable Stars</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>BP Cru is actually two stars engaged in a very macabre dance. One of them is a cool blue hypergiant, an aged behemoth a hundred times larger and fifty times more massive than our Sun <a href="#references">&#91;2,3&#93;</a>. The other is a tiny, tiny neutron star – the remnant of an even heavier behemoth that died long ago <a href="#references">&#91;3&#93;</a>. This dead star, whose internal structure defies and haunts our astrophysical understanding, has about twenty quilometers of diameter, yet it has a mass of about two Suns – pause for a moment and contemplate that&#33; We have here a giant monster dancing a fifty-day-long dance with a strange zombie. And it is a dance that is anything but boring&#33;</p> <blockquote> <p>We say a star is alive if it still fuses atoms into other atoms in its core to produce energy, preventing it from collapsing under its own weight. &quot;Dead stars&quot; like neutron stars are not made of normal atoms and sustain themselves through physical processes weirder than science fiction.</p> </blockquote> <div class=row ><div class=container ><div class=center ><img src="/assets/blog-figures/bpcru.png" alt="" /></div></div> <p><em>Artistic impression of BP Cru. Both the location in the sky as well as the binary system configuration are shown. The neutron star, represented as the white shiny speckle, orbits around the blue hypergiant. As it moves inside the dense wind of the blue star, it emits copious amounts of X-rays. For scale the sun is represented with an orange dot.

However, their brightness, winds, and violent deaths as supernovae change the course of entire galaxies and forge most of the atoms that make up you and me. Therefore, understanding how these stars live and die is fundamental to understanding where we came from and why the night sky looks the way it does. Most high-mass stars, alive or dead, dance or have danced with another star. Often, such dances between a dead and an alive massive star produce X-rays, producing what we call High-Mass X-ray Binaries.</p> <blockquote> <p>The term &quot;High Mass X-ray Binary&quot; &#40;or HMXB&#41; refers to any system made of a dead massive star, like a black hole or a neutron star, and a massive star orbiting each other and emitting X-rays because of their interaction – yes, the same radiation used to image our bones&#33;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>BP Cru is the only known system where this exact type of behemoth – a cool blue hypergiant – is leading its dead companion in such a dance – i.e, the only cool blue hypergiant that is a HMXB</strong> <a href="#references">&#91;4&#93;</a>. The hypergiant is so large and bright that it launches its surface layers into space as a stellar wind. As the neutron star orbits through this wind, it violently pulls the surrounding gas toward itself. The friction of the infalling gas produces copious amounts of X-rays.</p> <p>In the figure above I illustrate with false colors how the system would look like – in reality its brightness is so huge &#40;of half a million Suns&#33;&#41; that it would fry any camera or your eyes if you reach close enough to see the stars like that. This, of course, if you would survive the strong winds that reach more than one million quilometers per hour&#33;</p> <p>With its uniqueness, BP Cru may be the only observable example of a very brief snapshot in the life of certain high-mass stellar systems. How did such a system come to be? Why don’t we see more systems like it? How long can this system survive? What impacts will it have when it dies? We don’t know yet, but learning more about the past, present, and future of these dancing monsters will reveal exciting things about massive stars, and eventually about the Universe as a whole&#33;</p> <p><em>Abraços,</em></p> <div style="width:10%; margin:-10;"> <img src="/assets/signature-blue.svg" width=300px > </div> <div style="height:300%; margin:-10;"> <div class=colbox-blue >PS: Some personal coincidences about this are remarkable&#33; BP is the acronym of my surname, and Cruzeiro do Sul, was the first constellation I identified in the night sky when I was a child&#33; Also, the observations were originally scheduled for 2027, but last week the first of them were rescheduled for tonight&#33; It is a true existential pleasure to be traveling to the place where I grew up &#40;Rio de Janeiro&#41;, gazing at the Southern Cross while the HST collects data for <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/hst-program-info/program/?program&#61;18129">my very first successful first-author observational proposal</a>&#33; Fingers crossed for clear skies in Rio and a smooth observation by HST&#33;</div> <h3 id=references ><a href="#references" class=header-anchor >References </a></h3> <p><a href="https://scixplorer.org/abs/2023A&#37;26A...671A.149F/abstract">Fortin et al. 2023</a></p> <p><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A&#37;26A...457..595K/abstract">Kaper et al. 2006</a></p> <p><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A&#37;26A...541A.145C/abstract">Clark et al. 2012</a></p> <p><a href="https://scixplorer.org/abs/2025hst..prop18129B/abstract">Bernini-Peron et al. 2025</a> and references therein.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Matheus Bernini Peron.
