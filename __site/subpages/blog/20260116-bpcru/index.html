<p>Tonight, at 5:25:19 UTC, the Hubble Space Telescope &#40;HST&#41; will be staring at the Southern Cross &#40;Crux, or Cruzeiro do Sul em português&#41;. For the first time, a very special star will be observed&#33; Its most famous name is BP Cru. In our line of sight, BP Cru lies close to α Cru, the brightest star in the constellation.</p>
<p>&#40;The name comes from its identification number in the Variable Star Catalog.&#41;</p>
<p>BP Cru is actually two stars engaged in a very macabre dance. One of them is a cool blue hypergiant, an aged behemoth seventy times larger and forty times more massive than our Sun. The other is a tiny, tiny neutron star – the remnant of an even heavier behemoth that died long ago.   This dead star, whose internal structure defies and haunts our astrophysical understanding, is no larger than 20 km, yet it has a mass two or three times that of the Sun – pause for a moment and contemplate that&#33;   We have here a giant monster dancing a fifty-day-long dance with a zombie. And it is a dance that is anything but boring.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog-figures/bpcru.png" alt="bp cru diagram">  &#40;We say a star is alive if it still fuses atoms into other atoms in its core to produce energy, preventing it from collapsing under its own weight. &quot;Dead stars&quot; like neutron stars are not made of normal atoms and sustain themselves through physical processes wilder than science fiction.&#41;</p>
<p>Most massive stars, alive or dead, dance or have danced with another star. However, BP Cru is the only known system where this exact type of behemoth is leading its dead companion in such a dance. The hypergiant is so large and bright that it launches its surface layers into space as a stellar wind. As the neutron star orbits through this wind, it violently pulls the surrounding gas toward itself. The friction of the infalling gas produces copious amounts of X-rays – yes, the same radiation used to image our bones&#33; This is why such a system is called a High-Mass X-ray Binary.</p>
<p>Massive stars live fast and die quickly – at least in astronomical terms, lasting only a few million years. However, their brightness, winds, and violent deaths as supernovae change the course of entire galaxies and, last but not least, forge most of the atoms that make up you and me. Therefore, understanding how these stars live and die is fundamental to understanding where we came from and why the night sky looks the way it does.</p>
<p>With its uniqueness, BP Cru may be the only observable example of a very brief snapshot in the life of certain high-mass stellar systems. How did such a system come to be? Why don’t we see more systems like it? How long can this system survive? What impacts will it have when it dies? We don’t know yet, but learning more about the past, present, and future of these dancing monsters will reveal exciting truths about massive stars&#33;</p>
<p>Another drop from the ocean of mysteries will become a piece of knowledge.</p>
<p>PS: Some personal coincidences about this are remarkable&#33; BP is the acronym of my surname, and Cruzeiro do Sul, was the first constellation I identified in the night sky when I was a child&#33; Also, the observations were originally scheduled for 2027, but last week the first of them were rescheduled for tonight&#33; It is a true existential pleasure to be traveling to the place where I grew up &#40;Rio de Janeiro&#41;, gazing at the Southern Cross while the HST collects data for my first successful observational proposal&#33;</p>
